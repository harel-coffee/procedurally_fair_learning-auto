Survey description: 
We ask each worker questions about all 10 features. For each feature, we repeat the following:
	(i) We ask if they believe that it is fair to use the feature in a certain decision making scenario. 
	They can provide answers on a 7 point Likert scale, where 1 = Strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree. 

	(ii) Based on their answer to the previous question, we ask them to tell us all of the reasons that made them believe that it is fair/unfair to use the feature. 

	If their answer was \in [1,4], we show them questions asking them why they thought it was unfair. 
	If their answer was \in [4,7], we show them questions asking them why they thought it was fair. 
	This means that if their answer was = 4, we show them both sets of questions.

	As possible answers, we allow them to select multiple of the following 9 reasons: the 8 inherent properties + "other reasons", where we allow them to also write down the other reasons they might have considered. 

	For all of the questions that were shown to them, if a reason was selected, its value is set to 1 in the database, otherwise it is set to 0. 
	For the questions that were not shown to them, the value is set to np.nan.


Data description:
	The first column is the worker_id. 

	The following 10 columns contain answers to question (i), with column names of the form "fairness__<feature>". Values = [1,7]

	The following 180 columns with names of the form "<inherent_property>__<feature>", containing answers to question (ii). 
	There are 160 columns for the inheret properties (8 inherent properties * 10 features * 2 fair/unfair) + 20 for "other reasons" (1*10*2). 
	Values = {0,1,np.nan}


10 features:

8 inherent properties: 
["volitionality", "reliability", "privacy", "relevance", "causes_outcome", "caused_by_sensitive_feature", "causal_loop", "causes_disparity_in_outcomes"]
