Survey description: 
We ask each worker questions about all 10 features. 
For each feature, for each inherent property, we ask them to rate how much they agree with statements of the form <feature> has <inherent_property>. 
We also ask them if to rate how fair it is to use that feature, either right before or right after the questions about inherent properties.
They can provide answers on a 7 point Likert scale, where 1 = Strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree.
